### Using git

Git is a versioning tool, used to safely store your local files on a remote server. We are using GitHub as our remote storage.

When you want to stage the changes you have locally you need to add one or more files using

```bash
git add <file-name1>
git add <file-name2>
...
```

Then, you can commit the files using

```bash
git commit -m"Your short commit message goes here"
```

And finally you need to push the commited files to the remote with

```bash
git push
```
